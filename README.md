Samples of Video-SA (Video Data for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis)

The data set contains nearly a thousand pieces of emotions video data, each of which is 30s (split into 10s each), from major film and television dramas. This data set is mainly used for multi-modal sentiment analysis. Images, speech and text modalities can be extracted from each video. The sentiment label not only contains the traditional 6 emotions: "happy", "sad", "angry", "disgust", "fear", and "surprise". It also includes complex emotions and advanced rhetoric such as "sarcasm", "self-deprecating", and "simile" (but labeled with main emotions). We have written and contributed a multi-modal emotional computing paper. After subsequent publication, we will open source the project code and manually mark the information.

samples of this dataset will be upload before 2023.
